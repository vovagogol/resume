					Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the neces<wbr>sary time needed to understand your product vision.<br>
					The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of <wbr> work.<br>
					Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need.
